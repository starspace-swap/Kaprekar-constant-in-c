Kaprekar's Constant 6174 
 6174 is known as Kaprekar's constant after the Indian mathematician Dattatreya Ramchandra Kaprekar.
 The Constant is the result of a mathematical process that involves rearranging the digits of a  four-digit number that has at least two different digits to form a largest number possible and a smallest number possible , then Subtracting the smaller number from the larger number and Repeating until the result is 6174. 
This file demonstrate the same by showing the above mentioned processes by which we achieve a result of 6174 for an entry of a 4 digit number .
